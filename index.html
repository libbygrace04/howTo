 <ul>
   <li> There are 3 main groups for curls and I am going to tell you about them!</li>
   <li>Everyone has at least some type of wave or curl to their natural hair. It's incredibly rare for someone to have stick straight hair naturally. </li>
   <li>First we have 2a, 2b, and 2c. These are the wavy categories.These curls have a loose s shape, and are very pretty when styled correctly! 2a is the loosest wave, and 2c is the tightest</li>
   <li>Next we have 3a, 3b, and 3c. These are the curly haired gals! These curls are more ringlets, and are tighter than the 2's.</li>
   <li>Last we have 4a, 4b, and 4c. These are the kinky coily curls that are the tightest of them all!</li>
 </ul>

<h2 id="Washing">Wahing and Conditioning your curls</h2>
 <li>With curly hair, you don't need to wash it every day. Depending on your hair type you can go 3 to 5 days without washing. Just wash when you need to, and don't dry out your hair! I typically wash my hair around every 3 days.</li>
 <li>Wet your hair and take your shampoo and massage it into only your scalp with your fingertips and rinse well. You don't want to put the shampoo onto your ends because it will dry them out, but don't worry! They will get clean when you rinse your scalp. The suds will run down as it rinses out and cleans your ends too.</li>
 <li>After cleansing take a generous amount of conditioner and apply it to your ends first and work up your hair with the rest, avoiding your roots. This is where our detangling brush comes in. Take your brush and starting at the bottom gently detangle your hair until you can brush through it smoothly and there are no knots. Rinse out about 80% of the conditioner.</li>
 <li>Deep Conditioning! You don't need to deep condition every wash, I would do one about once a week. Switch out your masks every week depending on how your hair feels. If you're hair is feeling damaged then you should use a mask that has some protein in it. If your hair feels dry and brittle then you should use a mask with some moisturizers in it! Also, almost always store bought hair masks are better than homemade hair masks. So go buy yourself some good hair masks, let the mask sit in your hair for 15 to 30 mins, rinse thoroughly, and apply a hair oil for some extra hydration and nourishment!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <h2 id="Styling">Styling</h2>
  <li>It's important to know before we start that water is your best friend and if your curls aren't clumping, add more water before products! Start with soaking wet hair and apply your leave in conditioner. Brush through thoroughly.</li>
  <li>After the leave-in, you need to take your fingers and slide them into your hair by your temples, pulling half of your hair up. Then apply your curl cream to that section. Take your denman brush and a piece of your hair. Place the brush underneath your hair and brush in an arc motion, continue that until you've finished with that section.</li>
  <li>When you've finished the bottom section, scrunch your hair to encourage the curls to form. Then take down half of the top section and repeat. Adding water as needed, and once you reach the top section your going to take your brush, place it behind the peice of hair and brush straight upwards, and let the hair fall naturally. Scrunch to encourage the curls then move on to the next step.</li>
  <li>Then your going to add your gel and gently glaze it over your hair and scrunch upwards. Do not rake this through your hair! The gel is going to hold the curls we have defined with our brush so do not rake through!</li>
  <li>After the gel, we are going to plop. Plopping is just using a cotton t shirt or microfiber towel to dry our hair and reduce frizz. I use a t shirt, and I start by laying the t shirt on a flat surface, and the top of the t shirt furthest away from me. Then gently place your curls in the middle of the shirt, roll the base of the shirt toward your hair, and bring it up and around the base of your neck. Then while holding the t shirt at the base of your neck, pull the top of the t shirt around to the front of your head and tie the sleeves together. Let it stay on for about 20 to 30 mins, and then take it off down upside down to reduce frizz and keep definition. Now onto drying!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <h2 id="Drying and Finishing Up">Drying and Finishing Up</h2>
  <li>Some like to just let their hair air dry, and some like to go half and half and let it dry for a few and then diffuse or vise versa! I personally like to diffuse the best!</li>
  <li>Once you take the plop down, this step is optional, but I like to put my head upside down and apply hairspray to my roots. This just helps me with volume and frizz at the roots. Then glaze your mousse over your hair and scrunch it all in.</li>
  <li>Now we are going to diffuse! I like to start by hover diffusing. Hover diffusing is pretty self explanitory, and is when you hover the diffuser around your head without touching your hair at all. I start with high heat and air, and my head upside down. When you start to feel a crunch form, then you can take the diffuser and scrunch the hair up and hold it for a few seconds and move to a different place, until your hair is all dry.</li>
  <li>You should feel a little crunch and that is ok! We are going to scrunch out the crunch! Take a little oil in your hands, smooth the oil over your curls and scrunch, scrunch, scrunch! While you're scrunching, gently pull apart your curls and fluff out your hair!</li>
  <li>And that's it! Super easy, and beautiful curls!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <h2 id="Sleeping With Your Curls">Sleeping With Your Curls</h2>
  <li>Sleeping with curly hair can be very tedious, but once you find what works for you it's a game-changer!</li>
  <li>There are a many different ways people like to sleep with their curls, but my two favorites are the pineapple bun and sleeping with a silk bonnet!</li>
  <li>I prefer sleeping with my hair in my silk bonnet, which you can find on amazon for around 5 to 10 dollars, it keeps all my hair on top of my head and is the easiest way to sleep in my opinion. I also use a satin pillowcase, which is also really nice for curly hair and acne prone skin! Anyways, you just gently put the bonne over your head, and I like to shake my head to make sure I all my curls are in a good place where they won't be wonky the next day. When I wake up, i just flip my head over, gently take it off upside down, scrunch in some product, diffuse, and your ready to go!</li>
  <li>My second favorite way to sleep with my curls is sleeping in a pineapple bun. I really only like to sleep with a pineapple when i'm using my silk pillowcase, because it drastically reduuces frizz and makes my hair look a lot healthier! A pineapple bun is a loose bun on the very top of your head, secured with a silk scrunchie or invisibobble. Yes, it looks very similar to a pineapple! You can secure it with anything that will be gentle on your hair. When you wake up, gently take down the bun and fix any wonky curls with some product, I like to diffuse ater I refresh, and then you're good to go!</li>
  <li>Again, these are my favorite ways to sleep with curly hair, but there are many others! So do your research and do what works best for you!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <h2 id="Curls!">Curls!</h2>
  <li>Have fun with your curls, and remember that all curls are different and beautiful in their own ways!</li>
  <li>Also, this is my routine, but what works for me might not work for you! Everyone is unique! Do your research, try new things, and find out what works for you and your curls!</li>
  <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
